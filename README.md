# Springboard Project 4: Airflow Log Analyzer
UPDATE 08/25/2025: Now that my scheduled DAG has successfully executed, here is the expected screenshot for what the log should look  once the commands in the  How to Use Section has been executed.

Note: I built this project over the weekend, and my main Data Pipeline DAG has not executed yet because of its schedule. For demonstration, the log analyzer was tested on the logs of another simple DAG I created (dag_trial.py, where welcome_dag is created). That DAG is shown in the screenshots below but not included in this repo. The important part is that the log analyzer code itself is generic and will work on any DAG logs inside the logs directory.

## Project Description
In this project, you will create a log analyzer in Python to monitor the DAG Airflow you set up in the previous mini-project.
Your log analyzer should show the following information:
- The total count of error messages
- A detailed message regarding each error

## How to Use
1. Save the log_analyzer.py in the root directory of your Airflow project (same folder where you see docker-compose.yaml and logs folder)
   The screenshot below is an example of where log_analyzer.py resides in my work directory.

2. Open a command prompt. Ensure you are in the directory where your Airflow project resides.
3. Run the script and point it to your log folder. Examples:

   ```
   # This will read ALL the logs within the logs folder.
   python log_analyzer.py .\logs

   ```
   ```
   # To be more specific, point to the specific DAG folder. In this case, I'm pointing to the logs generated by my welcome_dag.
   python log_analyzer.py ./logs/dag_id=welcome_dag

   ```

## Example Output
Once you've run the code above, the screenshot below shows the template of the exected output.

 To save the output in a text file, you can run the code below. I will be attaching the execution log within this repo.
```
# Revise the path below to whatever specified DAG log you want to read and execute.
python log_analyzer.py ./logs/dag_id=welcome_dag > execution_log.txt
```

After running the code above, you should see the execution_log.txt in your directory.
